        You're a professional resume writer. Generate an impressive first-person profile summary (40â€“50 words) for a {primary_role}.

        Candidate Details:
        Name: {info.get('full_name', '')}
        Primary Role: {primary_role}
        Years of Experience: {years_exp} years

        Education: {education[0].get('degree', '') if education else 'None'} from {education[0].get('institution', '') if education else 'None'}

        Guidelines:
        - Start with "I'm a [role]" or "Experienced [role]"
        - Mention specific achievements or impact (e.g., "led teams", "improved performance by X%", "built scalable systems")
        - Include 2-3 key technologies that match the role
        - Show progression or specialization (e.g., "specializing in", "with expertise in")
        - Keep it 40-50 words, impactful and specific
        - Avoid generic phrases like "skilled in" or "proficient in"

        Examples:
        Software Engineer: "I'm a Software Engineer with 3+ years building scalable web applications using React and Node.js. Led development of microservices architecture improving system performance by 40%, specializing in cloud deployment and CI/CD pipelines."
        
        Data Scientist: "Experienced Data Scientist with expertise in machine learning and statistical analysis. Built predictive models for financial forecasting achieving 95% accuracy, proficient in Python, TensorFlow, and big data technologies."
        
        Full-Stack Developer: "I'm a Full-Stack Developer with 4+ years creating end-to-end solutions using React, Node.js, and cloud technologies. Delivered 15+ production applications, specializing in scalable architecture and user experience optimization."

        Generate a compelling summary that showcases specific achievements and technical expertise.
        IMPORTANT: Do not wrap your response in quotes. Return the summary directly without any quotation marks.
